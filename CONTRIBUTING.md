## Code Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python style
- Use descriptive names for variables and functions
- Add comments for complex code
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task

### Well-Formatted Code Example

```python
def dividir_amostras(amostras, num_grupos):
    """
    Divide a list of samples into groups randomly.
    
    Args:
        amostras (list): List of samples to be divided
        num_grupos (int): Number of groups to be created
    
    Returns:
        list: List of groups with distributed samples
    """
    random.shuffle(amostras)
    grupos = [sorted(amostras[i::num_grupos]) for i in range(num_grupos)]
    return grupos
```

### Commit Structure

Use clear commit messages:

- `Add: new feature`
- `Fix: bug correction`
- `Update: improvement of existing feature`
